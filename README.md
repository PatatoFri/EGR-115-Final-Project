EGR 115 Final Project
Created a 'Flight Computer' that created a mock METAR and compared inputed weather minimuns to it, calculated distances between inputed airports and fuel consumption, and calculates weight and balence based on inputed weights and fuel. 
Select a few random airport codes such as HKFD, KDAB, and KJFK and try it out.
